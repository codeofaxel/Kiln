  title="Our First Real Prints: Two Users, Two Printers, Zero Manual Steps"
  description="Chris and Dillon used AI agents to print coasters end-to-end — different agents, different printer brands, no human intervention. Here's what happened."

<p>
  Last week, two people we know ran Kiln on their own printers for the first time. No hand-holding, no prepared environment — just their machines, their agents, and a casual text message. Both got coasters. Here's what happened.
</p>

<div class="demo-video">

    aria-label="Chris and Dillon demo video — end-to-end prints via AI agent"
  ></video>
  <p class="caption">Chris (Bambu Lab A1 Mini) and Dillon (Prusa Mini) — both printing with AI agents, no manual intervention.</p>
</div>

<h2>Chris: "Yo actually can you print me another coaster"</h2>

<p>
  Chris has a <strong>Bambu Lab A1 Mini</strong>. He was already using an agent called <strong>Wren</strong> for other tasks. At 12:49 PM, he sent it a message:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yo actually can you print me another coaster</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  One minute later, Wren responded: <em>"On it. Sending coaster.gcode.3mf to Kiln now."</em> Followed immediately by: <em>"Print job started. Should be heating up now."</em>
</p>

<p>
  Chris asked Wren to monitor it and check in when done. Wren replied that it was running <code>kiln wait</code> in the background. Then nothing — Wren just quietly watched the job.
</p>

</div>

<p>
  At 1:31 PM — 42 minutes later — Chris texted "How is it looking." Wren had already beaten him to it: <em>"All done. 100% complete — your coaster's ready to go."</em>
</p>

<p>
  Chris: <em>"Sweet let me come check."</em> Wren: <em>"Cool. Let me know how it came out."</em>
</p>

<div class="asset-img">

</div>

<p>
  That's the whole interaction. A text message, an agent that handled everything underneath — file transfer, print start, monitoring, completion notification — and a coaster sitting on the bed when Chris walked over.
</p>

<h2>Dillon: Live webcam updates, every 30 minutes</h2>

<p>
  Dillon runs a <strong>Prusa Mini</strong>. His agent is called <strong>Clawdence</strong>. Same idea — ask the agent to print, let it handle the rest. But Dillon's setup added something extra: Clawdence used Kiln's webcam snapshot tool to check in on the printer periodically and send Dillon actual photos of the job in progress.
</p>

<div class="asset-img">
  <img
    src="/demo/dillon-clawd-monitor.jpg"
    alt="Clawdence agent sending Dillon live webcam snapshots with print progress stats"

  <p class="caption">Clawdence confirming the job is live: "Print #1 is running! Your Prusa Mini+ should be heating up now." The agent handled everything from the ask to the start.</p>
</div>

<p>
  Every update included the real printer data — hotend temperature, bed temperature, progress percentage, time remaining. Not a guess. Not a cached value. Pulled live from the Prusa, formatted, and sent directly to Dillon's phone.
</p>

    loading="lazy"
  >
  <p class="caption">Prusa Mini screen says FINISHED. The textured coaster came out clean.</p>
</div>

<p>
  When the job finished, Dillon walked over, popped the coaster off the magnetic bed, and put it to immediate use.

<h2>What this proves</h2>

<p>
  A few things stood out watching these two runs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Different agents, same Kiln.</strong> Wren and Clawdence are completely different AI agents built by different people. Both talk to Kiln through the same MCP tools. The agent doesn't matter — if it speaks MCP, it works.</li>
  <li><strong>Different printers, same interface.</strong> Bambu Lab uses a proprietary MQTT protocol. Prusa uses Prusa Link's REST API. Kiln normalizes both into the same set of tools. The agent calls <code>get_printer_status</code> and gets the same shape of response regardless of what's underneath.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring is built in.</strong> Dillon didn't have to write any polling logic. Clawdence used <code>kiln wait</code> and Kiln's webcam tools out of the box. The agent just had to decide to use them.</li>
  <li><strong>The interaction is just a text message.</strong> Neither Chris nor Dillon opened OctoPrint, Bambu Studio, or PrusaSlicer. They texted their agents. That's the interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Try it yourself</h2>

<p>
  Kiln is free and open-source. If you have a 3D printer running OctoPrint, Moonraker, Bambu Lab firmware, or Prusa Link — you can hook it up to your agent today.
