# Kiln — Open Tasks

Prioritized backlog of features and improvements.

## High Priority

## Medium Priority

### Webcam Streaming / Live View
Beyond snapshots (now implemented), full MJPEG stream proxy for real-time monitoring dashboards. Lower priority than snapshots since agents primarily need point-in-time checks.

## Low Priority / Future Ideas
