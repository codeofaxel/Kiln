# Kiln — Open Tasks

Prioritized backlog of features and improvements.

## High Priority

_(No high-priority tasks remaining.)_

## Medium Priority

### OTA Firmware Updates
Moonraker supports firmware updates natively via its API. Could expose as `kiln firmware-update` CLI command and `update_firmware` MCP tool. OctoPrint has a plugin for this too. Safety-critical — needs confirmation gates.

### Webcam Streaming / Live View
Beyond snapshots (now implemented), full MJPEG stream proxy for real-time monitoring dashboards. Lower priority than snapshots since agents primarily need point-in-time checks.

## Low Priority / Future Ideas
