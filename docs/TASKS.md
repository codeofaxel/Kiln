# Kiln — Open Tasks

Prioritized backlog of features and improvements.

## High Priority

- **Landing page / docs site** — Single-page site with: what Kiln is, demo GIF, install command, whitepaper link, project docs link, GitHub link. GitHub Pages or similar. Domain TBD.
- **Demo video / GIF** — 60-second screen recording: install → discover printer → slice → print. Embed on landing page and README.
- **Claim PyPI names** — Register `kiln-print`, `kiln-mcp`, and `kiln3d-octoprint` as pending publishers or publish placeholder packages.

## Medium Priority

_(No medium-priority tasks remaining.)_

## Low Priority / Future Ideas

- **Local model cache/library** — Agents save generated or downloaded models locally with tagged metadata (source, prompt, dimensions, print history) so they can reuse them across jobs without re-downloading or re-generating.
- **Pre-commit hooks** — Add black, ruff, mypy, pytest smoke tests for contributor DX.
- **Dependabot config** — `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency updates.
