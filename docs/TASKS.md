# Kiln — Open Tasks

Prioritized backlog of features and improvements.

## High Priority

_(No high-priority tasks remaining.)_

## Medium Priority

_(No medium-priority tasks remaining.)_

## Low Priority / Future Ideas

- **Opt-in anonymous telemetry** — Collect anonymized print success/failure rates, common error patterns, and printer model distribution. Aggregate data feeds back into improving safety profiles and slicer defaults. Must be strictly opt-in with clear data policy.

- **Claim `kiln-print` and `kiln-mcp` on PyPI** — Register as pending publishers or publish placeholder packages to reserve the names.
- **Register `kiln3d-octoprint` on PyPI** — Add as pending publisher, then uncomment the publish job in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
- **Local model cache/library** — Agents save generated or downloaded models locally with tagged metadata (source, prompt, dimensions, print history) so they can reuse them across jobs without re-downloading or re-generating.
