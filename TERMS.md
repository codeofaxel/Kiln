# Kiln Terms of Use

*Last updated: 2026-02-12 · Version 1.0*

## What Kiln Is

Kiln is open-source infrastructure software for controlling 3D printers and
interacting with third-party model marketplaces. It is a tool — not a
marketplace, print service, or content platform.

## Your Responsibility

By using Kiln you agree that:

1. **You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws** in your
   jurisdiction, including but not limited to regulations governing
   manufacturing, intellectual property, export controls, and product safety.

2. **You are responsible for what you print.** Kiln does not monitor, filter,
   or restrict the geometry of files you download, generate, slice, or send to
   your printer. The decision to print any object is yours alone.

3. **You are responsible for printer safety.** While Kiln includes safety
   systems that enforce physical limits (temperatures, speeds, G-code
   validation), these systems reduce risk — they do not eliminate it.
   Unattended 3D printing carries inherent fire and mechanical hazards.
   Follow your printer manufacturer's safety guidelines.

## Third-Party Content

Kiln connects to third-party model marketplaces (Thingiverse, MyMiniFactory,
Cults3D, and others). Content from these services is governed by their
respective terms of use and licensing. Kiln does not host, curate, endorse,
or take responsibility for any third-party content.

## Third-Party Fulfillment

When you route print jobs to external fulfillment providers, those providers
operate under their own terms of service, content policies, and legal
obligations. Kiln facilitates the connection but is not a party to those
transactions.

## No Warranty

Kiln is provided **"as is"** without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
The authors and contributors are not liable for any damages arising from the
use of this software, including but not limited to property damage, personal
injury, lost data, or legal liability resulting from objects you manufacture.

## Changes

These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of Kiln after an
update constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. Material changes will
prompt re-acceptance during setup.
