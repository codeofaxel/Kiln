# Changelog

All notable changes to Kiln are documented here.
Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Cross-printer learning feedback loop with auto-outcome recording from scheduler
- `recommend_settings` MCP tool for history-based print setting recommendations
- Outcome-aware preflight warnings (low success rate advisories)
- `get_started` MCP onboarding tool for AI agents
- `safety_status` MCP dashboard tool
- `confirm_action` two-step confirmation gate for destructive operations
- `safety_audit` MCP tool for querying the safety audit log
- Smart printer routing based on historical success rates
- Tier-aware agent error messages with suggested alternative tools
- Agent onboarding improvements (`get_started` tool, session recovery hints)
- Fly.io deployment support (`deploy.sh`, `Dockerfile.api`, GitHub Actions workflow)
- Circle setup script (`scripts/circle_setup.py`) for one-time entity secret and wallet provisioning
- Health check endpoint (`/api/health`) on REST API
- Donation info endpoint on REST API

### Changed
- `generate_and_print` and `download_and_upload` no longer auto-start prints (upload only, explicit start required)
- Auto-print toggles for marketplace and generated models (env var opt-in, default OFF)
- SKILL.md reorganized: quick start moved to top, fulfillment section added, JSON response examples
- Enriched `kiln status --json` with `printer_name` and `printer_type` fields
- Improved config validation errors with actionable quick-fix suggestions
- Bambu MQTT timeout error now includes troubleshooting checklist
- Rewrote Circle payment provider for W3S Programmable Wallets API (replaced deprecated Transfers API)
- Circle payments now use RSA-OAEP entity secret encryption for secure wallet operations

### Fixed
- CI failures: OpenSCAD macOS fallback test on Linux, flaky uptime test tolerance
- Bambu A1/A1 Mini uppercase state parsing
- Bambu A-series implicit FTPS on port 990
- Print start confirmation polling for Bambu printers
- YAML parse errors now surfaced instead of silently returning empty config

### Dependencies
- Added `cryptography>=41.0` to payments optional dependencies

### Security
- Safety audit log records all guarded/confirm/emergency tool executions
- Emergency cooldown escalation (circuit breaker) for repeated blocked actions
- Unified temperature limit resolution via safety profiles (single source of truth)
- Pause/resume rate limiting to prevent mechanical wear
- Dry-run mode for `send_gcode`
- G-code auto-detect printer profile from slicer comments

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- OctoPrint REST adapter (full printer control)
- Moonraker REST adapter for Klipper-based printers
- Bambu Lab MQTT adapter for X1C, P1S, A1 over LAN
- Prusa Connect REST adapter for MK4, XL, Mini+
- MCP server with 79+ tools for AI agent printer control
- CLI with 47+ commands and `--json` output on every command
- Fleet management: multi-printer registry, fleet status
- Priority job queue with background dispatch and auto-retry with exponential backoff
- Mandatory preflight checks before print jobs
- G-code safety validation with per-printer limits (26 printer safety profiles)
- Bundled slicer profiles for 14 printer models (PrusaSlicer/OrcaSlicer)
- Printer intelligence database (firmware quirks, material compatibility, failure modes)
- Pre-validated pipelines: quick_print, calibrate, benchmark
- Slicer integration (PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer) with auto-detection
- Model marketplace adapters: Thingiverse, MyMiniFactory, Cults3D
- Fulfillment service adapters: Craftcloud, Sculpteo
- Text-to-model generation via Meshy AI (cloud) and OpenSCAD (local)
- Mesh validation pipeline (STL/OBJ parsing, manifold check, dimension limits)
- Print cost estimation from G-code analysis
- Material and spool tracking with mismatch warnings
- Bed leveling trigger system with configurable policies
- OTA firmware updates for OctoPrint and Moonraker
- Webcam snapshot capture and MJPEG stream proxy
- Print history and agent memory persistence (SQLite)
- Cross-printer learning database with outcome tracking
- Closed-loop vision monitoring (snapshot + print phase hints)
- Print failure analysis and post-print quality validation
- Await print completion polling tool
- Local vs. fulfillment cost comparison tool
- Webhooks with HMAC-SHA256 signing
- Event bus with pub/sub
- Cloud sync for printer configs and job history
- Plugin system with entry-point discovery
- API key authentication with scope-based access
- Billing/fee tracking for fulfillment orders (5% platform fee, first 5 free/month)
- Multi-model agent support via OpenRouter (any OpenAI-compatible LLM)
- REST API wrapper (FastAPI) exposing all MCP tools as HTTP endpoints
- Tool tiers: essential (15), standard (43), full (101+)
- Network printer discovery via mDNS and HTTP probing
- Device type generalization (FDM, SLA, CNC, Laser forward-compatible)
- Resumable marketplace downloads with HTTP Range headers
- One-line install script for Linux/macOS

### Security
- Temperature range enforcement per printer and material
- Path traversal prevention on snapshots, slicer output, and Bambu file operations
- Agent tool result sanitization (injection pattern stripping, truncation)
- REST API hardening: parameter filtering, rate limiting, CORS lockdown, body size limits
- Payment address validation (Ethereum, Solana)
- Plugin loading gated by allow-list
- OpenSCAD input validation (size limit, dangerous function blocking)
- File upload validation (existence, size, empty file rejection)
- G-code batch size limits (100 commands max)
