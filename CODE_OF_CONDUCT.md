Kiln controls physical machines. Bad code can damage printers, waste material, or hurt people.
We take that seriously. Everything else is pretty simple.

- **Safety is non-negotiable.** If your change touches printer control, G-code validation, or
  temperature limits — test it twice. Physical consequences are real and irreversible.
- **Be straightforward.** Push back on bad ideas hard — just don't make it personal.
- **Help others learn.** Good bug reports, clear commit messages, and honest documentation
  make everyone's life easier.
- **Respect the hardware.** Printers are expensive. Material is expensive. Don't waste either
  by shipping untested code.

That's it. No formal enforcement process. Maintainers use judgment.
